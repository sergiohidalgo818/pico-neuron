# Pico Neuron

A C/C++ implementation of a framework for running neural models on a raspberry pico.

## TODO
- Change frequency behaviour (or name)
- Check if fs are needed on cfg files (probably not)
- Check if there is improvement changing the floats to integers (and precision loss)
- Manuel, adjust neuron speed
